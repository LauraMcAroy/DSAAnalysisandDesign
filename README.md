These projects compared three different types of data structures and the worst case run time scenarios of each, in order to determine which should be used to store a class schedule. The code was then created to load and store classes in a data structure, in this case a vector, print functions were implemented using buble sort to sort all courses alphabetically when printed, and search functions were implemented to locate specific courses and view any applicable prerequisites. 

The biggest roadblock I encountered was using pushback to print the items as they were stored into the vector. The error message stated that the variables i was using were overloaded, and I never found the way to correct the issue. I thought that initializing the empty vector would correct it, but that was unsuccessful. 

My abilities to create more modular and reusable code through the use of functions have expanded exponentially. So much time is saved by creating a function that can be used to multiple segments of code. Although, I would have liked to have to have redone the menu display code to make it more functional and reusable.
